Single Utility for Instance Management across AWS, Azure and GCP
================================================================

MCC: Command-Line Instance Control for Enterprise Cloud Providers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

|PyPi release| |lang|

----------------------------

Multi-Cloud-Control runs in two modes: List Mode and UI Mode. The command used to launch the utility determines the mode of execution:

- **mccl** - List Mode - display list of instances and data from all providers in formatted table and exit

- **mcc** - Normal/UI Mode:

  - Display a numbered list of instances and data from all providers in formatted table
  - Prompt for command to execute: Start Node, Stop Node, Connect (via ssh) and Quit Utility
  - Upon command completion, instance data is refreshed, redisplayed and the utility loops back to the command prompt.
  - Potential Future Commands: change node configuration (hardware, disks, network), create/delete node, image/snapshot node, storage control


Supported Platforms & Python Versions
-------------------------------------

Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6

Platforms:

- Linux
- macOS (OS X)

Pre-Reqs
--------

Some libraries used for secure authentication may require compilation during the installation process.  If compilation is required, the following packages must be installed before the ``pip install`` command (listed below) is executed: 

**Installing Pre-Reqs on Debian / Ubuntu Based Systems:**

.. code:: shell

  sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev -y

**Installing Pre-Reqs on RedHat / CentOS Based Systems:**

.. code:: shell

  sudo yum install gcc python-devel openssl-devel libffi-devel -y


Installation
------------

This utility can be installed with **pip**:

.. code:: shell

  sudo pip install mcc

Configuration
-------------

The first time the utility is executed:

- It creates its config directory **{HOME}/.cloud**
- It copies a sample config.ini file to the config dir
- It instructs the user to add their credential information to config.ini

Notes while editing the config.ini file:

- be careful not to change the names of the keys (titles left of the '=' symbol)
- comment lines may be deleted (lines beginning with #)

**config.ini sections**

.. code::

  [info]
  # example - connect to all three providers
  providers = aws,azure,gcp

  # the "providers" key specifies which cloud providers to connect to
  # it may contain any subset or combination of "aws", "azure" and "gcp"
  # each provider listed must have a corresponding credentials section of the same name


**[aws] section** - specifies your AWS security credentials and default datacenter region. `Information on AWS Credentials <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html>`_


.. code::

  [aws]
  aws_access_key_id = EXCEWDYSWRP7VZOW4VAW
  aws_secret_access_key = CHVsdhV+YgBEjJuZsJNstLGgRY43kZggNHQEh/JK
  aws_default_region = us-west-1


**[azure] section** - specifies your Azure Tenant-ID, Subscription-ID, Application-ID and Application-Secret.  `Creating an Azure Service Principal <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal>`_


.. code::

  [azure]
  az_tenant_id = a3b7de99-6c36-e71f-e7d7-c5a1eefd9c01
  az_sub_id = 2ac1b147-fdca-947c-4907-3f302a667100
  az_app_id = ee16ad1d-d266-bffa-031c-008ab40d971e
  az_app_sec = 22918C9e1cCC7665a+b3e4052f942630aE979CF68/v=


**[gcp] section** - specifies your Google Compute Service Account, the name of your access key (use JSON formatted key), and your Project ID.  `Information on Setting up Service Account Authentication <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances>`_


.. code::

  [gcp]
  gcp_svc_acct_email = 37646997249-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
  gcp_pem_file = SampleProject-72fcfdb29717.json
  gcp_proj_id = sampleproject-634368

  # gcp_pem_file is the filename of the key (JSON file)
  # copy the key (JSON file) to the config directory: {HOME}/.cloud
